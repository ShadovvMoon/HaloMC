HaloMD
======

HaloMD extends the life of Halo and makes mods fun again for the Mac.

HaloMD is a fairly ambitious project. Its source code notably shows off:

- Querying info from Halo game servers
- Writing a keygen (although not necessary) by analyzing Halo's code
- Running through Halo maps querying/altering for info.
- Altering Halo userdata such as game profiles
- Injecting code to alter the game at run-time
- Adding a XMPP chat-room client
- Implementing 3rd party support for adding and updating mods, with delta binary patches
- Writing a master server replacement by sniffing packets

Source code unless mentioned otherwise (eg: keygen, mach_override, crc32forge.py, DSClickableURLTextField, SCEvents) is under BSD 2-clause.

Artwork and audio files are not under this license.
