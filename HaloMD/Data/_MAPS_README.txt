---MAPS LOCATION & MODDING---

Open HaloMD. In the menubar, go to Mods -> 'Reveal Mods in Finder'

This is the Maps folder you are all familiar with. For adding mods, use Mods -> Add Mods menu option.
It will tell you if the mod is invalid and if it doesn't conform to HaloMD modding practices.

DO NOT place maps in the DO NOT MODIFY folders in HaloMD's application bundle. It will NOT work!
